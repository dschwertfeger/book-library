============

This is a digital book library application which I'm building to learn Backbone's 
conventions based on [Exercise 2: Book Library - Your first RESTful Backbone.js App](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-2-book-library---your-first-restful-backbone.js-app) in [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog/ "Blog")'s book
[Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/).
